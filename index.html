            <h2>
                <b>Battlegrounds Mobile India</b> (in short form BGMI previously known as PUBG Mobile India) 
                is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by Krafton. 
                The game, a aesthetically altered version of PUBG Mobile (a game banned in India), 
                is exclusively for the Indian users.
                After the early access release for Android users (on 17 June, 2021), 
                IGN India, on June 21, 2021, first reported that the data regarding users' 
                Android device was being sent to Tencent owned China servers.
                "The one reason behind this could be because of PUBG Mobile account transfer feature 
                that Krafton is allowing BGMI players to transfer their account and game data from 
                PUBG Mobile to BGMI till December 2021," 
                reported The Times of India.

                After the data sharing violation,
                Krafton, the developer of Battlegrounds Mobile India released a small 
                in-game update on June 22, 2021 to fix the data sharing issue with China 
                located servers. However, it was also reported that the game may ping to 
                Chinese servers if a user deletes the application data.
